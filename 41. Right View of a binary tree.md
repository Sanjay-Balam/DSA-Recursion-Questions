# 1. Skyscraper Right View
- **Problem:** You are in a city where buildings are arranged in a binary tree-like structure. Standing on the right side of the city, you can only see certain buildings, with taller ones blocking the view of smaller ones behind them. You need to find out which buildings are visible from the right side of the city. Can you write an algorithm that returns the list of buildings visible from this angle?

- **Input:** A binary tree where each node represents a building.

- **Output:** A list of buildings visible from the right side.

# 2. Viewing Family Hierarchy

- **Problem:** A family tree is organized in a binary structure, and you are looking at this family from the far-right side during a family reunion. You can only see the family members whose positions are not blocked by anyone else. Can you write a function to return the list of family members visible to you from the right side of this family tree?

- **Input:** A binary tree representing a family hierarchy.

- **Output:** A list of family members visible from the right view.

# 3. Treehouse Observation
- **Problem:** You are standing in a park that has treehouses arranged in a binary tree structure. If you stand on the right side of the park and look at the treehouses, some will be blocked from view by others in front of them. You need to determine which treehouses are visible from your position on the right. Can you provide an algorithm that returns the visible treehouses?

- **Input:** A binary tree where each node is a treehouse.

- **Output:** A list of treehouses visible from the right view.

# 4. Right-side Mountain View

- **Problem:** You are climbing a mountain range arranged in a binary tree structure. From your position on the right side of the range, you can only see certain peaks as taller ones block the view of smaller ones behind them. Write an algorithm that returns the list of mountain peaks visible from your current viewpoint.

- **Input:** A binary tree where each node represents a mountain peak.

- **Output:** A list of mountain peaks visible from the right view.
