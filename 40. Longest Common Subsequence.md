# 1. DNA Sequence Matching:
- **Problem:** You are working as a bioinformatician, and you are analyzing DNA sequences to find similarities between different species. You are given two DNA sequences represented as strings of characters. Your task is to determine the length of the longest common subsequence between these two DNA sequences. This will help in identifying evolutionary links between species.

Example: <br>

- Input: `str1 = "ACGTAC", str2 = "GCTACT"`
- Output: `4`

# 2. Version Control History:
- **Problem**: You are a software engineer working on a version control system. Two developers, Alice and Bob, have been working on the same project and have made changes independently. The system represents each version of the project as a string of characters. To understand the similarity between their changes, you need to find the longest common subsequence between their versions. Write a program that returns the length of the longest common subsequence between the two version strings.

Example: <br>

- **Input:** `str1 = "v1.0.1", str2 = "v1.0.2"`
- **Output:** `5`

# 3. Text Editor Comparison:
- **Problem**: You are building a feature for a text editor to help users track changes between two drafts of a document. To provide meaningful feedback to the user, you need to compute the longest common subsequence between the two drafts. This will allow you to highlight the sections that are retained in both versions. Implement a program that returns the length of the longest common subsequence of two draft versions of the document.

Example: <br>

- **Input:** `str1 = "abcde", str2 = "ace"`
- **Output:** `3`

# 4. Music Playlist Matching:
- **Problem**: You are building a music streaming service, and users can create custom playlists. Given two playlists created by different users (represented as sequences of song titles), your task is to find out the length of the longest common subsequence of songs between their playlists. Write a program that returns the length of the longest common subsequence.

Example: <br>

- **Input:** `str1 = "rock, pop, jazz", str2 = "classical, jazz, pop"`
- **Output:** `2`
